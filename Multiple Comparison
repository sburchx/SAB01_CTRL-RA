How Tukey's HSD Adjusts P-Values
Tukey's method controls the family-wise error rate (FWER), ensuring that the probability of making at least one Type I error across all pairwise comparisons is below your significance level (commonly 0.05).
This adjustment is necessary when performing multiple comparisons because it reduces the likelihood of false positives.
